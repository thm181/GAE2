# Scenario 1

## Setup code chunk:

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
# We can include comments inside code chunks by prefacing with "#"

# The opts_chunk$set() function sets the default behavior for all code
# chunks except the one it is in. Here I've told Rmarkdown to print out the 
# code chunk and to suppress information messages (but not warnings) in the
# code chunks that follow. We will usually set echo = FALSE to suppress
# printing the code in our output.

# You can change the behavior of individual code chunks by clicking on the 
# gear icon at the top right of the chunk and choosing your preferred options.

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = TRUE,
	message = FALSE,
	warning = TRUE
)

library(papaja)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
library(latex2exp)   # Allows me to use LaTeX in ggplot2


# Use the papaja package to create a bibliography of package citations:
papaja::r_refs(file = "R-GAE2.bib")
